These are a few of the things we're hoping to work on:
 * Get it working on OSX
 * Loading data from a dump (import of Mediawiki viget.org)
 * Better documentation
 * Configuration of ports (solr/haystack, dev server)
 * Configuration of default settings
 * Look into using sqlite (Spatialite) for dev
 * Whoosh instead of solr

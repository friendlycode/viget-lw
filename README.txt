Viget-lw is an easy way to get started developing on the viget.org localwiki.
It is designed for Ubuntu 12.04, but should also work on 10.04 without many 
changes. The idea is to make the installation and setup of a localwiki 
development environment easy and repeatable.

Notable changes from the localwiki dev install docs are:
 * Uses a user-controlable solr instead of a system service
 * All install and setup commands are available via make
 * Clean (teardown) commands are also available via make

The INSTALL.txt file has the instructions for getting you started.
TODO.txt will give you an idea of where we'll be taking this.
